It has been a few months since I posted and so I am writing a brief update about what I've been up to in that time.

## Graduation

First of all, I graduated my BSc (hons) Computer Science course! Very exciting, and I am quite pleased with my result. Moving house and getting work lined up has, however, been a big time sink.

Perhaps I will set my sights on a masters or a doctorate in the future - possibly in cyber security.

## Wiley Edge

I was offered a place on a training programme at Wiley Edge. They are a consulting firm working with leading financial institutions worldwide to recruit and provide training for software development and finance roles.

The specific course I completed was Software Development with Java, which focused on dev-ops and building full-stack applications using the spring framework. I definitely learned some new things! Training concluded at the beginning of October and the work that I completed can be found on my [GitHub account](https://github.com/aidlran/C299). I am now in the "talent pool", and I am interviewing with various recruiters at financial institutions.

## What's Coming

I have had some interesting tech upgrades that I will be writing about. I recently upgraded my server with more storage and so have been playing with ZFS. I've also been trying out Graphene OS (a privacy-first version of Android).

I have some other articles planned that I hope to get to, including a high level introduction to Bitcoin & blockchain, and maybe a PSA or two about privacy and protecting your data.

Finally, I'm hoping to have some more time to put into some of my software projects. It will be nice working on something useful, even if only for me, rather than the finish-and-forget exercises we have to do during a course.

Until next time.
