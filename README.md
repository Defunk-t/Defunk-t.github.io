## About

My website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Installation

See Jekyll's [website](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) for information about its requirements.

With the requirements met:

```sh
# Install the bundler gem

# Use this to always install dependencies to the project's vendor directory
bundle config --global path vendor/bundler

# Install Gemfile gems
bundle install

bundle exec jekyll build
```
